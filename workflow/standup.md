If you encounter a **blocker**, please immediately inform the rest of the development team ASAP! This can be done by raising the **blocker** in the daily standup. Or immediately post it on our [Google Digipay Engineering Chat Room](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#chat/space/AAAAXQpiy0I). The sooner that we are aware what blocker you are encountering the better we can help you and overcome the blocker.
